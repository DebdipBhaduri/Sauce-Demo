Project Description
Selenium Automation for Sauce Demo

This project is a Python-based Selenium automation script designed to interact with the Sauce Demo website. Sauce Demo is a web application that provides a testing ground for automation scripts, making it ideal for practicing Selenium WebDriver functionalities.

The primary objective of this project is to automate a typical e-commerce user flow:

1.Logging In: The script automates the process of logging into the Sauce Demo website using predefined credentials.

2.Adding Items to Cart: Once logged in, the script selects a product from the inventory and adds it to the shopping cart.

3.Checkout Process: The script navigates through the checkout process, filling out necessary customer information such as first name, last name, and postal code.

4.Order Confirmation: The script completes the purchase and verifies that the order was placed successfully by checking for the confirmation text "Thank you for your order!".
