# Sauce-Demo
This project automates a user flow on the Sauce Demo website using Selenium WebDriver in Python. It logs in with predefined credentials, adds an item to the cart, completes the checkout process, and verifies the successful order by checking for the confirmation message "Thank you for your order!"
